To better assess a candidate's development skills, we would like to provide the following challenge. You have as much time as you'd like (though we ask that you not spend more than a few hours).

##Submission Instructions

1. First, fork this project on GitHub. You will need to create an account if you don't already have one.
1. Next, complete the project as described below within your fork.
1. Finally, push all of your changes to your fork on GitHub and submit a pull request. You should also email the appropriate address listed in the first section and your recruiter to let them know you have submitted a solution. Make sure to include your GitHub username in your email (so we can match people with pull requests).

## Project Description

Build an iOS/Android app that consumes a [json feed](http://sheltered-bastion-2512.herokuapp.com/feed.json). Produce an application that displays a list that best displays the relevant data, customizing things as needed to make things fit. (See the [sample row](http://github.com/lschallenges/mobile-engineering/blob/master/sample_row.png) in the repo for a mockup, but please feel free to design the app in any way you want.)

Here's what your mobile app must do:

1. Your app must consume the above JSON feed
2. Display the content from the feed in a reasonable manner
3. You must use platform native code (No PhoneGap, Xamarin, etc.)

Your app does not need to:

1. Persist any data

Your application should be easy to set up and run.

## Evaluation

Evaluation of your submission will be based on the following criteria. Additionally, reviewers will attempt to assess your familiarity with standard libraries. Reviewers will attempt to assess your experience with Android/iOS based on how you've structured your submission.

1. Did your application fulfill the requirements?
1. Did you follow the instructions for submission?
